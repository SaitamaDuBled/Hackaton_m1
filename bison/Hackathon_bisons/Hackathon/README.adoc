= Hackathon 2025

== Deployment with Docker

To deploy the application using Docker images and containers, follow these steps:

. Install https://www.docker.com/[Docker] on your device

. Build the MariaDB and PHP custom images by running the following commands in a terminal from the project root:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t mariadb-hackathon -f dockerfile-db .
docker build -t php-hackathon -f dockerfile-php .
----

. Deploy a `hackathon` container with the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
docker-compose -p hackathon up
----

Three sub-containers will be deployed:

* `php`: PHP container hosting the application, accessible at port 80
* `mariadb`: MariaDB container hosting a database (port 3306)
* `phpmyadmin`: PHPMyAdmin container hosting an interface to manage the database, accessible at port 8899

You can manage your containers and images using https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop].
